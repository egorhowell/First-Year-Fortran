# University Fortran Coursework
- These are my university physics coding problems which were solved in Fortran.

- Many of these are very basic physics problems which include:
  - Root finding
  - Determinant of a matrix
  - Projectile motion
  - Integration
  - Taylor Expansion
  - Heat Diffusion
  - Trapezoidal Function
  - Mercury's and Earth's Orbital Radius
 
- Feel free to look through the codes.
